Sticky navigation bar with BoxMedia logo (scalable SVG for crisp visuals).
Navigation menu with smooth scroll-to-section behavior and active section highlighting (e.g., underline or color change).
Dark/light mode toggle with a sleek animated switch (e.g., sun/moon icon transition).
Subtle hover effects on menu items (e.g., scale or color shift).
Mobile-friendly hamburger menu with a smooth slide-in animation.
Hero Section:
Full-screen section with a dynamic, animated background (e.g., WebGL particle effects, subtle gradient flow, or looping MP4 video fallback for performance).
Bold tagline with a typewriter effect (e.g., “We craft unforgettable digital experiences”) using GSAP or Typed.js for smooth text animation.
Prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) button (“Explore Our Work”) with a micro-interaction (e.g., ripple effect or 3D tilt on hover).
Optional: Subtle mouse-trail or cursor animation for desktop users to enhance interactivity.
Portfolio Section:
Grid-based layout (responsive 3-column desktop, 1-column mobile) with masonry-style card arrangement for visual interest.
Each card features a high-quality project image with a creative hover effect (e.g., image zoom, overlay with project title, and description fade-in).
“Live Demo” and “Learn More” buttons with animated hover states (e.g., border glow or slide-in effect).
Lazy-loaded images for performance optimization.
Filterable categories (e.g., Web, Branding, UI/UX) with a smooth transition effect when filtering.
Services Section:
Visually distinct cards or icon-based tiles for services (Web Development, Branding, Social Media Management, UI/UX Design, SEO, Digital Marketing).
Each card includes an animated icon (e.g., Lottie animation or SVG path morphing) and a brief description.
Cards animate into view with staggered entrances (using AOS or Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered animations).
Subtle 3D tilt effect on hover using libraries like Tilt.js or pure CSS.
Skills Section:
Animated circular progress bars or radial gauges (using SVG or Canvas) to showcase expertise in tools/technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Figma, SEO, etc.).
Progress animations trigger only when the section is in view for optimal performance.
Include percentage labels and tooltips for each skill with a brief description.
Responsive design ensures readability on mobile devices.
Team Section:
Stylish team member cards with circular profile pictures, job titles, and social media icons (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter).
Hover effect reveals a short bio in a sleek modal or card flip animation (using CSS 3D transforms or GSAP).

Optional: Randomized team member order on page load for dynamic presentation.
Testimonials Section:
Smooth, auto-rotating carousel (using Swiper.js or pure CSS) with client quotes, names, and company logos.
Interactive navigation dots or arrows with hover animations.
Cards include subtle parallax or depth effects during scrolling.
Accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support for quotes.
Contact Section:
Clean, minimalist form (Name, Email, Message) with animated input field effects (e.g., label float or underline expansion).
Form is for display only (no backend submission) but includes client-side validation feedback (e.g., red border for empty fields).
Contact details (email, phone, social media icons) with clickable links and hover animations.
Optional: Animated map background or subtle location pin animation.
Footer:
Minimalist design with copyright notice, quick links to sections, and social media icons with hover scaling effects.
Include a subtle wave or gradient divider above the footer for visual separation.
Optional: Newsletter signup placeholder for future scalability (display-only).
✅ Design Style
Aesthetic: Futuristic, minimalist, and premium with a black-and-white base palette and vibrant accent colors (e.g., neon blue, purple, or gradient hues).
Typography: Use modern, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Poppins, Inter, or Montserrat) with variable font weights for flexibility and performance.
Color Palette: Monochromatic base (#000, #FFF) with accent gradients (e.g., #00DDEB to #8B5CF6) for CTAs, hovers, and section dividers.
Animations:
Smooth transitions and micro-interactions (e.g., button hovers, card reveals) using GSAP or CSS animations.
Scroll-triggered animations with AOS or Intersection Observer for fade-ins, slide-ups, and scale effects.
Parallax scrolling effects for backgrounds or images to create depth without compromising performance.
Section Dividers: Use wave, diagonal, or geometric shapes (SVG or CSS clip-path) for elegant transitions between sections.
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with fluid layouts, ensuring seamless UX across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, high-contrast mode support, and screen reader compatibility.
